# Analysis of accidents on road in India (Dashboard on Excel).

## Problem Statement
Everyday while reading newspaper or watching news we came across many news related to accidents on roads with different severity levels. In India alone there are around 1130 accidents and 422 deaths everyday. So, we want to create a Road Accident Dashboard (2021 - 2023)  so that government and the respective authority can have insights on the daily happening accidents in India and they can decide measures and precautions that can be taken to stop the daily happening casualties. Moreover, we want to classify the accidents in urban and rural area as well. This will help us and the government to know where the peoples are more vigiliant of traffic rules and what the initiatives they can launch to reduce the accident cases.

## Solution Approach
Basically, client wants a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 to 2023 so that they can have insights on the road accidents in India, with different severity levels and area. We have decided to divide the visuals in 2 levels named Primary level KPI and Secondary level KPI. Primary level KPI are the basic numbers which provide the overall image of the Road Accidents in India whereas Secondary level KPI describes the indepth visuals for the accidents based on severity , area range, casualties by road type and road surface , casualties by location and day/night.

Primary KPIs include -

1 - Total casualties taken place after the accident.

2 - Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vechile.

Secondary KPIs include - 

1 - Total casualties with respect to vechile type.

2 - Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year.

3 - Maximum casualties by road type.

4 - Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface.

5 - Relation between casualties by area/location and by day/night.

I have created these KPIs and visuals and presented it in the form of Excel dashboard. I have used pivot tables, VLOOKUP formula, features of excel to create this complete dashboard. In the dashboard, I have provided some icons in the navigation bar through which you can go through the data analysis page , gmail me for any queries related to dashboard, moreover you can access the data set as well.
